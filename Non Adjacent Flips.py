# You are given a binary string S of length N. You can perform the following operation on S: 
# Pick any set of indices such that no two picked indices are adjacent. Flip the values at the picked indices (i.e. change 0 to 1 and 1 to 0).
# For example, consider the string S=1101101.
# If we pick the indices {1,3,6}, then after flipping the values at picked indices, we will get 1101101 â†’ 0111111. 
# Note that we cannot pick the set {2,3,5} since 2 and 3 are adjacent indices. Find the minimum number of operations required to convert all the characters of S to 0.
