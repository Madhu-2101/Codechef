# Chef has N bags and an integer X. The ith bag contains coins such that Aiâ‰¤X. In one operation, Chef can: 
# Pick any bag and increase its coins to X. Formally, if he choses the ith bag, he can set Ai=X. 
# Given that the cost of performing each operation is C (Câ‰¤X) coins and Chef can perform the above operation any (possibly zero) number of times, determine the 
# maximum value of: $\sum_{i=1}^N A_i$ $-$ total cost paid by Chef, if Chef performs the operations optimally.
