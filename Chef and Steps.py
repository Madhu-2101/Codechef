# In order to establish dominance amongst his friends, Chef has decided that he will only walk in large steps of length exactly K feet. However, this has presented 
# many problems in Chefâ€™s life because there are certain distances that he cannot traverse. Eg. If his step length is 5 feet, he cannot travel a distance of 12 feet. 
# Chef has a strict travel plan that he follows on most days, but now he is worried that some of those distances may become impossible to travel. Given N distances, 
# tell Chef which ones he cannot travel.
